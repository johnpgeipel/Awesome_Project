PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This is an application that utilizes both the weather forecast in the users area as well as top news stories to recommend a beer of appropriate potency. For instance, if the forecast is sunny and the news is uplifting, perhaps a light shandy or pilsner. If the weather sucks and the news is depressing, try a Barley Wine or a Barrel-Aged Porter. The app will also allow to view the weather forecasts for that day in their area and also click on the daily news articles to read brief abstracts of the day’s news. This will provide the user with a better understanding of why they were recommended a particular beer. 

API’s TO BE USED:
We will most likely use an API called “Punk API” for the information regarding beer potency and type. For the weather forecasts, we will use the openweather API (maybe another). For the daily news articles we will use the New York Times API, possibly the NPR API as well. We will likely have multiple news APIs in use. 

ROUGH BREAKDOWN OF TASKS:
Gather API data, analyze JSON, etc.
Create user interface
Write script
